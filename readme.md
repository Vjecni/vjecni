# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Your Name], a front-end web developer currently in high school. I have a keen interest in web development and love to learn about new technologies. Currently, I'm focusing on mastering Vue.js and building exciting projects with it.

Apart from web development, I'm also interested in penetration testing. It's fascinating to explore the vulnerabilities of a system and find ways to strengthen it. I believe that knowledge of penetration testing can help me build more secure web applications and enhance my problem-solving skills.
